        September, 2018 I was just received my letter from onja in order to do a leadership information and the last test, in this time also I was preparing for my last exam in secondary school.

        I was struggling to communicate with friends and staff because we were all come from different backgrounds but actually they are so opened with everyone.
        The camp went well and I have learned many things that I hadn't known before. Since then I tryed to make friends and getting well with them so it was effective. It doesn't mean that I hadn't any friend before, <q>I had!</q>, <em>endeed I had</em> but I got more than I had and even someone who hasn't a same generation with me after I had been trained at onja. I thanked onja staff and the members for the meeting which boosted my confidence and my skills to higher level.

        However, It's not just a good thing but also, it lead to a very big broblem with my families when I was willing to learn at onja and even made it hard to decide was when I passed my PEPC and PEPC Technic exam and also my vocational test in seminary school. Though, that didn't make any obstacle of my opportunity to study at onja Madagascar. Denyed to learn at high school because I knew that It would be hard for my mother to afford my study. I couldn't wait for it but lastly, I received a phone call to be collected as a onja student.
