        September, 2018 I was just received my letter from onja in order to do a leadership information and the last test, in this time also I was preparing for my last exam in secondary school.

        I was struggling to communicate with friends and staff because we were all come from different backgrounds but actually they are so opened with everyone.
        The camp went well and I have learned many things that I hadn't known before. Since then I tryed to make friends and getting well with them so it was effective. It doesn't mean that I hadn't any friend before, <q>I had!</q>, <em>endeed I had</em> but I got more than I had and even someone who hasn't a same generation with me after I had been trained at onja. I thanked onja staff and the members for the meeting which boosted my confidence and my skills to higher level.

        However, It's not just a good thing but also, it lead to a very big broblem with my families when I was willing to learn at onja and even made it hard to decide was when I passed my PEPC and PEPC Technic exam and also my vocational test in seminary school. Though, that didn't make any obstacle of my opportunity to study at onja Madagascar. I had to deny the learning at high school because I knew that It would be hard for my mother to afford my study. I couldn't wait for it but lastly, I received a phone call to be collected as a onja student.
