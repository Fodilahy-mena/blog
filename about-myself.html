        My name is jerome, I'm 20 years old and I come from a small town called
        Andovolalina which is located in the west of Mahanoro,
        Madagascar. I come from a family of farmers and I have six siblings- four brothers and two sisters.

        degree in secondary school. Now I am so glad that we learn a snew skill and willing to be a coder.
